##DESCRIPTION* : Task 2 involves the design and simulation of a **simple synchronous RAM module** using Verilog HDL to demonstrate memory design concepts in digital systems. The RAM is implemented as a 16×8 memory, meaning it contains 16 memory locations with each location capable of storing 8-bit data. The module operates synchronously with a clock signal and supports both read and write operations controlled by separate read enable and write enable signals. Data is written into the memory on the positive edge of the clock when the write enable signal is asserted, and data is read from the memory on the positive edge of the clock when the read enable signal is active. A Verilog testbench is developed to generate the clock, apply write operations to specific memory addresses, and then read back the stored data to verify correct functionality. The design is simulated using EDA Playground with the Icarus Verilog simulator, and waveform analysis is performed using EPWave to observe memory behavior, address selection, and data flow during read and write cycles. The successful simulation results confirm the correct operation of the synchronous RAM, and all design files, testbench code, and waveform evidence are organized and uploaded to a GitHub repository as part of the task submission.
